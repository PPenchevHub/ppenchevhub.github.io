<h2><center>Heap vs Stack</center></h2>
<p>1 A <b>Heap</b> is the memory address place assigned to a thread, where it can store all local and temporary variables.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Follows the LIFO(Last In First Out) principle</li>
  <li>Grows and shrinks in size with the program</li>
  <li>
    <p>Doesnâ€™t require any kind of garbage collection</p>
  </li>
  <li>A <b>Stack</b> is the memory address place assigned to a process and all its threads, to store objects, classes and instance variables.</li>
  <li>Pointers are used for refferencing</li>
  <li>A garbage collector <b>MUST</b> be enforced</li>
  <li>Slow access time</li>
</ul>
