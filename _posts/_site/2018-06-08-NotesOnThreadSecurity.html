<p><b>What’s thread safety?</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Mechanisms and Methods to guarantee that parts of a programm, which is divided into many threads run corectly and without any unexpected side effects.</li>
  <li>Scheduling and Interleaving of threads shouldn’t make a difference, and the threads can complete their work without errors and with the expected behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Race Conditions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The result of an operation depends on the timing and order of events in a programm</li>
  <li>Special case is the <b>Data Race</b> where multiple parallel threads want access to a shared variable at the same time which leads to unxpected results</li>
</ul>

<ul><b>Types of Race Conditions</b>
<li>Read-Modify-Write - parallel running threads change the value of a shared variable based on the previous value of the same variable

example: 
'''java
public class Main {

	private int number;

	private void incrementNumber() {
		number++;

	}

	private int getNumber() {
		return number;

	}

	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
		final Main unsafe = new Main();

		for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {

			new Thread(new Runnable() {

				@Override
				public void run() {
					try {
						Thread.sleep((int)(Math.random()*100));
					} catch (Exception e) {}
						unsafe.incrementNumber();

					
				}
			}, "T" + i).start();

		}
		Thread.sleep(1000);
		System.out.println("Final number should be 1000 : " + unsafe.getNumber());
	}

}
